## You (Can't) Learn Japanese
It's an NGE joke.

Create a repo specifically for Cordova ver. with React replaced by React Native  
Raise / reset difficulty (Raise difficulty to max by writing 'hard souls')  
Button only / text only modes (Text only available through hard mode)  
Design changes  

# Ez
composer update  
composer require laravel/passport  
php artisan migrate  
php artisan db:seed  
php artisan passport:install  
npm install  
npm run watch-poll  
  
Edit .env file to use

# For easier use
In button mode, can use 1 2 3 4 5 6 q w e to submit answer.  
4 5 6 are the same as q w e respectively, but q w e is recommended for smaller screens.  
After submission 「next」 is focused so you can just press space/enter to continue.  
Hard mode doubles points on success, quadruples loss on fail
